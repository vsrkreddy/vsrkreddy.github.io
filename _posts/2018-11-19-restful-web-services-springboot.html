<p><strong>Create a RESTful web services using spring boot.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>go to SpringInitilizr to generate a spring boot maven project with following dependencies - web, devtools, jpa, h2, actuator etc.(groupid is like the name of package structure you want , artifact_id is the name of the project you want).</li>
<li><a href="http://35.229.62.76/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/RestfulServicesProject.zip">ZIP of RestfulServicesProject</a></li>
<li>Unzip and import in preferred IDE.</li>
<li>Generally CRUD operations are mostly used. CRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete. Operations are  like create user (POST), retrieve user (GET), update user (PUT), Delete User (DELETE).</li>
<li>Uri's examples, /users, /users/{id}, /users/posts/1.</li>
<li>Use annotations like @Controller (/@RestController), @RequestMapping(it will have the method which we are going to use like GET/POST(method = RequestMethod.GET, path = " path of the uri").</li>
<li>With that your can hit the endpoint from a browser and get the response back.</li>
<li><strong>Now, Let us take a step back to understand whats happening in the background - Spring framework will have classes, when you pull in the dependencies and run the spring boot application several beans for these classes (DispatcherServlet , <em>ErrorMvcAutoConfigurations</em> etc..) are created by spring boot auto configuration.</strong></li>
<li>@SpringBootApplication – indicates that this is <strong>spring context</strong> file. <strong>enables ""auto configuration"", enables component scan</strong> (scan this package and sub packages).</li>
<li><strong>DispatcherServlet</strong> handles all the request, It is also called the front controller.</li>
<li>DispatcherServlet looks for which controller to send the request to and sends it to that bean. Once it gets response it is mapped to @ResponseBody by <strong>message converter</strong> like jackson which returns the JSON response and then it sends the response back.</li>
<li>Some of important annotations are @PathVariable, @Service, @Controller, @Respository, @Configuration, @Entity, @RequestMapping, @Autowired etc.</li>
<li>Implementation of Basic Auth with Spring security - add spring-boot-starter-security dependency. default is user and password you get it in console logs.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>USEFUL TIPS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ResponseEntity&lt;T&gt; which is extension of httpEntity is useful for returning status code.</li>
<li>@ResposeStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_Found) on exception class.</li>
<li>implement generic Exception handling for all resources.</li>
<li>Can you javax validation API to perform validations for domain class variables.</li>
<li>Adhere to HATEOAS concepts.</li>
<li>Add in dependencies which supports both JSON and XML.</li>
<li><strong>Configure Auto generation of Swagger Documentation</strong>( similar to WSDL in SOAP) - add dependencies like springfox-swagger2, springfox-swagger-ui. write SwaggerConfig class use</li>
<li>@Configuration, @EnableSwagger2 on class, @Bean public Docket api() { return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2) } then go to localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring API's</strong> - if your application is down i want to know it as soon as possible. In spring this is provided by spring-boot-starter-actuator. also add dependency of <em>spring-data-rest-hal-browser. Hal browser will show all the hal services which are being exposed by spring-boot-starter-actuator (url for actuator- localhost:8080/actuator)(type local:8080 and put in the service which you want to see the details for).</em></li>
<li>Use @JsonIgnore to not send the value in the response.</li>
</ul>
